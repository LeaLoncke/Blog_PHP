# Blog: messages and comments

This is a work for my training.

I made a blog page in PHP, SQL and HTML.

It's a very basic page that displays messages using a database and when we click on the link "commentaires", we arrive at a page that displays this message and its comments.

You can add comments using a form and the POST method that saves the data in a "comments" table in the database.
